## Ingredients
| Qty             | Thing |
|-----------------|-------|
| 1/2 lb          | ground sausage
| 2 tbsp / 28.5 g | butter
| 4 tbsp          | flour
| 3 cups / 750 g  | milk
| 2 tsp           | garlic powder
| to taste        | salt and pepper

# Steps
1. In a medium pot
  1. On medium heat
    1. Brown crumbled sausage
    2. Remove sausage from pot, leave grease
  2. On low heat
    1. Melt butter
    2. Stir in flour
    3. Add milk
    4. Add salt, pepper, garlic powder
  3. On medium-high heat
    1. Stir occasionally until gravy becomes viscous
      * An easy way to tell is to dip your spoon into the gravy. The gravy will stick to the spoon and won't easily run off ([see picture below](#viscous-gravy))
    2. Add sausage
  4. Remove pot from heat, let gravy cool to thicken
