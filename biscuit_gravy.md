Brown sausage, remove from pot but keep sausage grease. Melt butter in pot, stir in flour. Add milk and heat while occasionally stirring with a whisk.
The butter/flour mixture should start combining with the milk and make up the gravy. Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Once the mixture is throughly 'gravy-like', add sausage and let cool.
