Based on [America's Test Kitchen's recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/13496-southside)

- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

# Rum

## Mai Tai

Based on [America's Test Kicthen's recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/13499-mai-tai)

- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange liqueur (Grand Marnier is best, Cointreau is also good)
- 3/4 oz orgeat syrup
- 1 oz freshly-squeezed lime juice
- 2 oz dark rum

Shake with ice, serve in old-fashioned glass, fill to top with crushed ice. Garnish with mint sprig
and lime slice

Rum choice is up to you, I'm still trying to find what's best. Some combo of dark rum (mixed with
molasses) and gold rum (aged in barrels) is good, I usually do 1 oz each of Koloa dark and gold.
Though for a proper mai tai, some Jamacian rum should be used.



# Whiksy

## Old Fashioned

- 2 dashes bitters
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 2 oz bourbon or rye whisky

Stir with ice for 20 seconds, strain into old fashioned glass with a large ice cube. Garnish with an
orange peel twist and cocktail cherry.
